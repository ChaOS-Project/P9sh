P9sh is a command line shell for Plan 9 operating system develop as a practice for the Operating Systems course at Rey JuanCarlos University at Spain.

= Why the name of P9sh? =
Well, at a first point because it's focused on Plan 9 (althought it compiles under Linux with Plan9port, and maybe i would do a native Linux/Unix version in the future), but also because P9 sound similar to Piranna :-P
