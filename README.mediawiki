P9sh is a command line shell for Plan 9 operating system and compatible with Linux/Unix.

Originally developed as a practice for the Operating Systems course at Rey JuanCarlos University at Spain, my intention is in the future add more features to become it more Unix-user friendly. Think of it more like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almquist_shell ash] than like [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rc rc].

= Why the name of P9sh? =
Well, at a first point because it's focused on Plan 9 (althought it compiles under Linux with Plan9port, and maybe i would do a native Linux/Unix version in the future), but also because P9 sound similar to Piranna :-P

= Characteristics =
* Low size
* Low memory footprint
* Clean and very legible code
* Highly modular

= Features =
* Input buffered
* Support for built-ins "a-la" [http://busybox.net BusyBox]
** cd
* Pipelines
* Stdin & stdout redirection
* Commands in background

= Requeriments =
== Linux/Unix ==
* [http://swtch.com/plan9port Plan9port]

== Plan 9 ==
* -Nothing- (obviusly... :-D )

= Built-ins =
A built-in in P9sh is simply a function with a C-main sign, so they are really easy to develop:
# copy&paste the original source code of the program to embed somewhere in the P9sh source tree (it's own file it's not a bad idea... :-) )
# rename the built-in main function to something different... and meaningful
# add an entry for the new built-in at getBuiltin() function
# ...et voila! :-D
